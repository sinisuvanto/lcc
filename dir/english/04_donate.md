<p>Language Crash Courses is free for users like you, thanks to the generous support of lots of volunteer translators, proof readers, 
IT specialists, etc. who have put in thousands of hours to make Language Crash Courses what it is now. We have only launched the 
first version of the website and there is still a lot to improve. We will add many more language courses and site languages for non-English speakers, 
but in order for us to survive long term and provide free services for an increasing number of users worldwide we need your support.</p>

<p>If you have been blessed by our courses and would like to help us ensure Language Crash Courses remains available to thousands of others then, 
please consider making a donation. A donation will allow us to hire web developers, pay for infrastructure, and continue to improve. 
All the money donated will go directly to funding Language Crash Courses development and infrastructure.</p>
