<p>Language Crash Courses has been made available to you thanks to the generous support of lots of volunteers. 
For LCC to continue to develop additional courses in many languages (also for our non-English speaking users)
we need the support of many others willing to use their time and skills to bless others.</p>

<p>We are looking for support in the following areas: </p>

<p>– <strong>Translators</strong> of any widely spoken language group, especially Russian, Hungarian, 
Japanese, Norwegian, Polish, Swahili, Tagalog, and Thai. You don’t have to be a professional translator 
as long as you are fluent in your mother tongue and have a university degree. We work according to set deadlines for delivering the translation work. </p>

<p>– <strong>Proof readers</strong>. We need at least two for each language. We also work according to set deadlines for proof reading.</p>

<p>– <strong>Language Coordinators</strong>. As a language coordinator you will be responsible for coordinating the whole process of 
translation, proof reading, editing, and providing the final Excel text files to be published online. You have to be a native speaker. 
You can be both a coordinator and a translator.</p>

<p>If you want to join our volunteer team then please go to ‘Contact’ and leave us a message. </p>
